# What's the difference between ld_libarary_path and library_path

<cite>
LIBRARY_PATH is used by gcc before compilation to search for directories containing libraries that need to be linked to your program.
LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used by your program to search for directories containing the libraries after it has been successfully compiled and linked.
