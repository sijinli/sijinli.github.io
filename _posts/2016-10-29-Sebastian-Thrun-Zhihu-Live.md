# Interesting points
+ one car's experience can  easily be transferred to all other cars, however this process is much slower for humans.
+ machine learning engineers are some of the *hottest people* 
+ Daily lives for machine learning engineers, 
         1. Look at the dataset
		   2. apply the machine learning techniques to the problem
		   
		            clear the data (big issue)
					
				    Use the best tool to solve the problem.
