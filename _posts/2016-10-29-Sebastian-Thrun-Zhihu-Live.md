# Interesting points
+ one car's experience can  easily be transferred to all other cars, however this process is much slower for humans.
+ machine learning engineers are some of the *hottest people* 
+ Daily lives for machine learning engineers, 
         + Look at the dataset
		   + apply the machine learning techniques to the problem
		           + clear the data (big issue)
				   + Use the best tool to solve the problem.
