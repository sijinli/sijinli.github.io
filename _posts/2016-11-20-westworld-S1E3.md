The Origin of Consciousness 
in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind

by Princeton University psychologist Julian Jaynes
Houghton Mifflin/Mariner Books (1976, 2000)

The idea that primitive man believed his thoughts to be voice of gods

i thought it was debunked.

the host heard their programming as an inner monologues
with hopes that in time their own voice would take over
it was a way bootstrap consciousness

one is in this place
the last thing you want the hosts to be is conscious


The idea is about mistake leads to consciousness,
maybe it would be residuel or recurrent?
