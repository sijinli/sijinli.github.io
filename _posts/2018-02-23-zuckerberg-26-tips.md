#### There's always time. Time is priorities.

#### Only play for 4-5 ours of real work per day.

#### It's normal to have days where you just can't work and days where you'll work 12 hours straight.
  
#### work more when you're in the zone. Relax when you're not.
  
#### Your time is $1000/hour and you need to act accordingly. --- Respect your time and make it respected.

#### Stop multi-tasking. It merely kills your focus.

#### Set up a work routine and stick to it. Your body will adapt.

#### We're always more focused and productie with limited time.

#### Work is the best way to get working. Start with short tasks to get the ball rolling.

#### Doing is better than perfect.  Work iteratively. Expectations to do things perfectl are stifing.

#### More work hours doesn't mean more productivity. Use constraints ars opportunities.

#### Separate thingking and executiion to execute faster and think better --- Separate brainless and strategic tasks to become more productive.


#### Organize meetings early during the day. Time leaing up to an evnet is offen  wasted.

#### A single meeting can blow a whole afternon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in.   Group meetings and communication(email or phone) to create blockes of uninterrupted work)

#### Keep the same context throughout the day. Switching between projects/clients is unproductive. 


#### Work around procrastinatino. Procrastinate between intense sprints of work(Pomodoro).

#### Break the unreasonable down into little reasonable chnks. A big gola is only achieved when every little thing that you do everday, gets you closer to that goal.

#### No 2 tasks ever hold the same importance. Always prioritize.  Be really careful with to-do lists.


#### Only ever work on the thinnk that will have the biggest impact.  Always know the one thing you really need to get done during the day.

#### Beak tasks into hour increments. Long tasks are hard to get into; feels like it all needs to get done.

#### If something can be done 80% as well by someone else, delegate. Delegate and learn to make use of other people.

#### Yesterday's home runs don't win today's games. Turn the page on yesteeerday only ever think about today and tomorrow. 

#### Set deadlines for everyting. Don't let taasks go on indefinitely.

#### set end dates for intense or stressful activities. Everthing ends at some point.

#### Get a reminder app for everything . Don not trust your own brrraain for yourm memory.  Always take notes.

#### write down anyting that distracts you-google searches, random thoughts, new ideads, whateer. The point is, if you write them down. they'll stoy bubbling up when you're in the zone. 

#### Take braks.Sometimes.
